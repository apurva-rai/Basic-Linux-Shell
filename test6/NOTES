PATH variable is used by the shell to search for executables specified using the relative path ("ls" vs "/bin/ls").
Thus, changing the PATH variable can affect the executable that is found and executed by the shell. 

Run the attached "bash6.txt" on your Linux command-line to see the expected output.

$> sh < bash.txt
