# Basic Linux Shell
# Quash
Simple lite implementation of a shell
# Build
Type "make into terminal with path set to the project directory"  
To run it simply type "./quash"
# Running Executables
Once inside quash you can run executables like you would on a normal linux shell with or without parameters.  
For eg. ./lab or ./lab data.txt
# Report
