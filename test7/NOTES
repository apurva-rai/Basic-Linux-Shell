The child process created using fork() typically inherits the environment of the parent process.
In your quash program, when a new environment variable is created using the "set" command, the new variable should be made visible to the child process.

For example, in the Linux bash shell we get the following:
$ unset MYVAR
$ MYVAR=NEW_ENV_VAR
$ echo $MYVAR
NEW_ENV_VAR
$ ./file7
MYVAR: (null)

Although "MYVAR" is set in the current process, it is not transmitted by the shell to the child process "file7".

In bash, you need to use "export" to actually update the environment variable that is sent to the child
$ unset MYVAR
$ MYVAR=NEW_ENV_VAR
$ echo $MYVAR
NEW_ENV_VAR
$ export MYVAR
$ ./file7
MYVAR: NEW_ENV_VAR


In your quash implementation, the "set" command should achieve the same effect as "export" in bash.
You should not use putenv() to do this, because that would be using the capabilities of the current shell (bash) to implement you quash shell.
Your shell should be able to function independently of bash.
So, explore the use of execle() or execvpe() that allows to pass an updated environment to the child process.
Also, use the following instance of main in your quash shell to get the initial environment:
int main (int argc, char **argv, char **envp)

You may use putend() as a last resort, but that should be included as a shortcoming in your report.
